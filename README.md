## Background:

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. We will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Questions for Exploration:

* Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization 

* Part 2:  Ilustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity 

## Methods for Analysis:

Utilized the datasets found in USGS and https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
Libraries & data visualization utilized: Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox


## Final Findings:

Locations/countries which are high risk in earthquake with high magnitude: Japan, Chile, Alaska, Iran, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Indonesia, Wallis and Futuna, Vanuatu
