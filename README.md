## Background:

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

## Questions for Exploration:

* Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

* Part 2:  Illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity

## Methods for Analysis:

* Utilized the datasets found in USGS and https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

* Libraries & data visualization utilized: Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox


## Final Findings:

Locations/countries which are high risk in earthquake with high magnitude levels: Japan, Chile, Alaska, Iran, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Indonesia, Wallis and Futuna, Vanuatu.
